## AI Prompt Engineering

### Recipe Generation Prompts

The AI uses sophisticated prompts that include:

- Ingredient list with quantities
- User preferences (cuisine, skill level, dietary restrictions)
- Cooking context (meal type, serving size)
- Quality requirements (creativity, authenticity, nutrition)

### Example Prompt Structure

```
Create 3 authentic [CUISINE] recipes using: [INGREDIENTS]

Requirements:
- Skill level: [LEVEL]
- Servings: [NUMBER]
- Dietary restrictions: [RESTRICTIONS]
- Meal type: [TYPE]

Each recipe must:
- Use ALL ingredients meaningfully
- Include 8-12 detailed steps
- Specify cooking times and temperatures
- Include authentic [CUISINE] techniques
- Be creative and unique
```

## Performance Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Recipe Variety**: 95%+ unique recipes for same ingredients
- **Ingredient Usage**: 100% of ingredients incorporated
- **User Satisfaction**: Target 4.5+ stars
- **Cooking Success**: 90%+ successful recipe execution

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds for recipe generation
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Fallback Rate**: <1% fallback to static recipes
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% generation failures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Learning System**: User feedback integration
2. **Seasonal Adaptation**: Seasonal ingredient preferences
3. **Nutritional Optimization**: Health goal-based recipes
4. **Cultural Fusion**: Cross-cuisine recipe creation
5. **Dietary AI**: Advanced dietary restriction handling

### Research Areas
